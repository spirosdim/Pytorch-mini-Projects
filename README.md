# Pytorch-mini-Projects
Apply different Neural Network architectures in Pytorch. The purpose of these notebooks is to apply Neural Network architectures with Pytorch on different problems.


1. [**Fully Connected Neural Network**](https://github.com/spirosdim/Pytorch-mini-Projects/blob/master/1.DNN_Pytorch.ipynb). Task: on a cybersecurity dataset, classify if each attack is benign or malicious.

2. [**Convolutional Neural Network**](https://github.com/spirosdim/Pytorch-mini-Projects/blob/master/2.%20CNN_mini_Project.ipynb) Task: Classify 10 classes of images (taken from Imagenet).
keywords: Pytorch, CNN, cyclic learning rate, one cycle learning rate, SGD, Adam, transfer learning, ResNet34 

3. [**Recurrent Neural Network**](https://github.com/spirosdim/Pytorch-mini-Projects/blob/master/3.%20RNN_mini_Project.ipynb) Task: Classify 6 classes of text based on the emotion of the text ('surprise', 'joy', 'sadness', 'anger', 'love', 'fear').
